# Zipline
### Problem:
There needs to be a way to get materials and people from Saddleback mountain to RSM. The best solution is a zipline that will send materials and/or people down from Saddleback mountain to RSM Intermediate.
### Constraints:
- [ ] Must be removable in under 3 minutes.
- [ ] Must stay on line (Wind factor/Mr. Bantle shaking rope may apply.
- [ ] The bearings must be moving.
- [ ] There must be an arm or bracket that hangs down to connect to whatever you're transporting.
- [ ] The line is 1/16 (0.0625) inches.
### Materials:
- 3D printed parts (ABS plastic)
- Laser cutted wood or acrylic
- Bolts and nuts (size TBD)
### Deliverables:
- [ ] All sketches and engineering drawings of final product (completed)
- [ ] All sketches and engineering drawings of parts (completed)
- [ ] Working prototype
- [ ] Presentation of final product (working)
- [ ] Detailed daily notes in engineering journal
### Allowance:
- ```The amount of space between two objects```
- Good allowance would be ±0.001
- 3D printers are prone to errors so use ±0.01, or for worse plastics ±0.025
### Just for Miles (on linux terminal):
- First use ```git clone https://github.com/awesomepop012/Zipline.git``` make sure that you are in a directory that you want to clone it into. It will automatically create a __Zipline__ directory
- __IMPORTANT!__ everytime before you add anything to the folder, run ```git pull origin master``` this will retrieve the most updated code from github. If you modify a file or add one to the folder first, this command may result in an error.
- If you want to commit something to the repository (an idea etc.) first use ```git add .```, this command will prepare the files to be committed. Next use ```git commit -m "{Your message}"```, this command will commit the files that you put in the *Zipline* folder or its subdirectories, to the git repository __on your computer!__ It won't push them to the repository hosted at github.com. The message will usually be what you updated or created, ex: *"Updated README.md."* Finally, after your done with what you're doing and have to leave the computer, use the command: ```git push origin master``` this command will push all of your commits that you made to github.com. __Make sure that you use add and commit before you use push!__
